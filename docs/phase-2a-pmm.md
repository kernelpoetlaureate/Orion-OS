Of course. This is the perfect time to get extremely granular. Phase 2 is where most hobby OS projects die from complexity. A meticulous plan will be your guide through the swamp.

This plan is designed to be a step-by-step, code-level blueprint for implementing your Physical Memory Manager (PMM). We will focus on building a robust, testable, and understandable system.

==================================================
ULTRA-DETAILED PLAN: PHASE 2A - PHYSICAL MEMORY MANAGER (PMM)
1. Objectives & "Definition of Done"

Primary Goal: To create a system that can reliably track and allocate every single 4KiB physical page frame in the machine.

Key Outcomes:

The kernel can accurately report the total amount of usable physical RAM.

The kernel can find and reserve a contiguous block of physical RAM for the PMM's own data structures (the bitmap).

The kernel has a function pmm_alloc() that returns the 64-bit physical address of a free page, or NULL if none are available.

The kernel has a function pmm_free() that takes a physical address and marks its corresponding page as available again.

The PMM correctly marks the memory used by the kernel itself and by the PMM bitmap as "used" and will never allocate it.

Extensive logging during initialization provides a clear audit trail of PMM decisions.

2. Design Philosophy & Key Decisions

Allocator Type: Bitmap Allocator.

Why: It's the most common and pedagogical choice. It's space-efficient (1 bit per 4KiB page means 1MB of bitmap can track 32GB of RAM). The logic is straightforward, involving bit manipulation, which is a key low-level skill to demonstrate.

Alternative (and why not): A stack-based (freelist) allocator is faster for individual allocations/deallocations but makes it harder to find contiguous blocks of pages later and is more susceptible to memory corruption. We will build a simple, robust system first.

Address Space Handling: The HHDM Is Your Best Friend

Problem: Your kernel code runs at a high virtual address (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFF80100000), but the PMM deals with physical addresses (e.g., 0x0000000000200000). How do you access the physical memory at 0x200000 to write your bitmap?

Solution: We will use the Limine Higher Half Direct Map (HHDM). Limine creates a mapping where all of physical memory is accessible starting at a specific virtual address offset. For example, physical address 0x1000 is accessible at virtual address hhdm_offset + 0x1000.

Action: You must request the HHDM from Limine. Your code will need two helper functions:

void* phys_to_virt(uint64_t paddr) which returns paddr + hhdm_offset.

uint64_t virt_to_phys(void* vaddr) which returns (uint64_t)vaddr - hhdm_offset.

This is the single most important concept in this phase. Every time you get a physical address from the PMM, you must convert it to a virtual address using phys_to_virt before you can write to it.

4. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Step 1: Initialization (pmm_init) - The Grand Tour

This is the main function. We will build it piece by piece.

Part 1.A: Pre-flight Checks and HHDM Retrieval

In pmm_init, check if the Limine memmap response is valid. If not, panic("PMM: Memmap response invalid!").

Retrieve the HHDM offset from hhdm_request. If the response is invalid, panic("PMM: HHDM response invalid!"). Store hhdm_request.response->offset in the global hhdm_offset. This is now your magic number for phys_to_virt.

Log the HHDM offset for debugging. LOG(INFO, "PMM: HHDM offset at 0x%llx", hhdm_offset);

Part 1.B: Find the Highest Address to Determine Memory Size

Iterate through the entire Limine memory map (memmap_request.response->entries).

Find the entry with the highest address (entry->base + entry->length). This determines the total size of memory we need to manage.

Store this in a local variable, highest_addr.

Calculate total_pages = highest_addr / PAGE_SIZE.

Calculate bitmap_size = (total_pages + 7) / 8; (the +7 ensures you round up to the nearest byte).

Log these calculated values: "PMM: Found %d pages of memory. Bitmap needs %d bytes.", total_pages, bitmap_size.

Part 1.C: Find a Home for the Bitmap

Now, iterate through the memory map again. This time, you're looking for a place to store the bitmap itself.

You need to find the first memory map entry where entry->type == LIMINE_MEMMAP_USABLE and entry->length >= bitmap_size.

Once you find such an entry, you have the physical address for your bitmap. uint64_t bitmap_paddr = entry->base;.

Convert this physical address to a virtual address you can actually write to: bitmap = (uint8_t*)phys_to_virt(bitmap_paddr);.

If you finish the loop and haven't found a suitable region, panic("PMM: Could not find a suitable location for the bitmap!").

Log the chosen location: "PMM: Placing bitmap at physical 0x%llx (virtual 0x%p)", bitmap_paddr, bitmap.

Part 1.D: Initialize the Bitmap State

First, mark all memory as used. This is safer than assuming it's all free.
memset(bitmap, 0xFF, bitmap_size); (0xFF means all bits are 1, i.e., "used").

Now, iterate through the memory map a third time. For every entry that is LIMINE_MEMMAP_USABLE, mark its corresponding pages as free.

For each usable entry:

Loop from i = 0 to i < entry->length in steps of PAGE_SIZE.

Calculate the page index: page_idx = (entry->base + i) / PAGE_SIZE.

Call your helper bitmap_clear(page_idx); to mark it as free (bit = 0).

Part 1.E: Reserve Memory for Critical Structures

The bitmap itself is using physical memory. We must mark those pages as used in the bitmap so we don't accidentally allocate them.

Loop from i = 0 to i < bitmap_size in steps of PAGE_SIZE.

Calculate the page index: page_idx = (bitmap_paddr + i) / PAGE_SIZE.

Call your helper bitmap_set(page_idx); to mark it as used (bit = 1).

Crucially, you must also reserve the memory used by your kernel's code and data. The Limine kernel_address request can tell you the physical and virtual base of your kernel. Iterate over the kernel's size and mark those pages as used in the same way.

Step 2: Implement Bitmap Helpers

These are small but critical.

bitmap_set(size_t bit): bitmap[bit / 8] |= (1 << (bit % 8));

bitmap_clear(size_t bit): bitmap[bit / 8] &= ~(1 << (bit % 8));

bitmap_test(size_t bit): return (bitmap[bit / 8] & (1 << (bit % 8))) != 0;

Step 3: Implement Allocation (pmm_alloc)

Implement find_first_free_bit():

Loop through the bitmap byte by byte (for i = 0 to bitmap_size).

If a byte is not 0xFF, it means there's at least one free page in this block of 8.

Once you find such a byte, loop through its 8 bits (for j = 0 to 7) to find the first 0 bit.

When you find it, calculate the final bit index: bit_index = i * 8 + j. Return this index.

If you search the whole bitmap and find nothing, return -1.

In pmm_alloc():

Call find_first_free_bit().

If it returns -1, log an error "PMM: Out of memory!" and return NULL (or 0).

If you get a valid index, call bitmap_set(index) to mark it as used.

Increment the used_pages counter.

Convert the bit index back to a physical address: p_addr = index * PAGE_SIZE.

Return p_addr.

Step 4: Implement Deallocation (pmm_free)

Take the p_addr argument.

Sanity Check: Ensure p_addr is page-aligned (if (p_addr % PAGE_SIZE != 0) { /* panic or log error */ }).

Convert the address to a bit index: index = p_addr / PAGE_SIZE.

Sanity Check: Ensure the page was actually in use: if (!bitmap_test(index)) { /* panic or log error */ }. Freeing a non-allocated page is a serious bug.

Call bitmap_clear(index) to mark it as free.

Decrement the used_pages counter.

5. Testing and Verification Strategy

In your kmain function, after calling pmm_init():

Initial State Verification:

Print the results of pmm_get_total_memory(), pmm_get_used_memory(), pmm_get_free_memory().

used_memory should be a reasonable number (size of kernel + bitmap size + some overhead). It should not be 0.

total_memory should roughly match what QEMU is configured with.

    LOG(ERROR, "PMM Test: pmm_alloc() failed!");
} else {
    LOG(INFO, "PMM Test: Allocated page at physical addr 0x%llx", (uint64_t)p1);
    // Now let's try to write to it!
    char* v1 = phys_to_virt(p1);
    LOG(INFO, "PMM Test: Virtual address is 0x%p", v1);
    v1[0] = 'H';
    v1[1] = 'i';
    v1[2] = '\0';
    LOG(INFO, "PMM Test: Wrote '%s' to page.", v1);
}

Free and Re-allocate Test:

C

content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
LOG(INFO, "PMM Test: Freeing page at 0x%llx", (uint64_t)p1);
pmm_free(p1);
LOG(INFO, "PMM Test: Re-allocating...");
void* p2 = pmm_alloc();
LOG(INFO, "PMM Test: Got new page at 0x%llx", (uint64_t)p2);
if (p1 == p2) {
    LOG(INFO, "PMM Test: Success! Got the same page back.");
} else {
    LOG(ERROR, "PMM Test: Failure! Did not get the same page back.");
}

Exhaustion Test (Optional but recommended):

In a loop, keep calling pmm_alloc() until it returns NULL. Count how many pages you allocated.

The number of pages allocated plus the initial used_pages should equal total_pages.
